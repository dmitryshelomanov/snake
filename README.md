## URL Params

- <b>cellSize</b>: number = 50 - Cell with/height
- <b>pageWidth/pageHeight</b>: number = window size - Canvas size
- <b>fps</b>: number = 15 - frame tick
- <b>borderSize</b>: number = 1 - cell border size
- <b>foodCount</b>: number = 50 - food count
- <b>snakeCount</b>: number = 1 - snake count
- <b>isVisibleBoard</b>: boolean = true - board visbile state

## Perfomance warning

Visualization is not designed for a large number of objects

I can add deep lvl for alghoritms and this will increase productivity but I can't optimize react renders, but can controll visible state for board
